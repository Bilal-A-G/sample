sample_app.c

Line 86: 
CFE_SB_RcvMsg pends forever.  Is there ever a situation where this should time out?
Would it be worth adding a second call to this function that times out, then having the developer 
choose which call to use, deleting the other?

Line 109:
Sets the run status to CFE_ES_APP_ERROR if SB read error, which causes the main loop to exit. 
Would it be good to comment this line out with a note to the developer to uncomment the line 
if they want to exit the main loop on SB read error?  In most cases I don't think you want the 
app to exit on a single SB read error. 

General: 
A device task may not make sense for all applications.  Should we provide a second sample app that 
does not include a device task or instructions for how to remove the device task?

I think it would be good to add a request housekeeping telemetry ground command (ie. ground cmd 
with cmd code). That will allow a developer to verify their apps telemetry interface with COSMOS 
without adding telemetry request messages to the Scheduler App.  

Some apps may not need to publish separate housekeeping and data messages on the software bus. Also, 
some apps may not need to publish an array of device data samples.  Maybe make that clear in the comments?  

I usually include device interface funtions in a separate .c file, like Vulcan_interface.c, as opposed to in 
the device task file.  The interace .c file includes no cfe stuff and is used/tested in the checkout app, then 
pulled directly over into the cFS app and reused.
